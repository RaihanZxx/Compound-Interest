    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

To run the application, ensure your virtual environment is active and execute:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The application will present a menu with various calculation options.

Example: Running Batch Calculations

You can use the batch_input.json file provided to test batch processing:

[
    {
        "principal": 10000,
        "rate": 5.0,
        "time": 10,
        "compounds_per_year": 12,
        "tax_rate": 10.0,
        "fee_rate": 1.0
    },
    {
        "principal": 5000,
        "rate": 3.5,
        "time": 5,
        "compounds_per_year": 4,
        "tax_rate": 5.0,
        "fee_rate": 0.5
    }
]

When prompted in the CLI, enter batch_input.json as the file path.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The config.json file allows you to set the default currency for calculations:

{
    "currency": "IDR"
}

Change "IDR" to your preferred currency code (e.g., "USD", "EUR", "GBP") to update the display currency.
